## Welcome to: HQ Packaging - Dielines

This is a work-in-progress, and eventually will be transferred to the GitHub account of [HQ Packaging](https://hqpackaging.com) once we have determined the most helpful way to present this information in order to facilitate as straightforward an artwork process for custom printed mylar bags as is possible. It is public in this "pre-alpha" stage because even without polish applied, some customers have already found the content to be helpful. If you have any suggestions for how we can better configure this to be useful, please feel free to send me a message via [email](mailto:joeholden@hqpackaging.com).

### What is this?

[HQ Packaging](https://hqpackaging.com) provides custom-printed mylar bags/pouches for many different industries and applications. One of the most common perceived hurdles in the process concerns artwork - the goal of this repository is to not only provide basic templates for many of the most common sizes and configurations (and continue to add to them), but also to present the information in such a way that if the size you are looking for has not been added, it will be relatively simple for you create artwork based on the principles oulined here.

While it would be easy to simply pick several sizes and limit customer choices to that set, we prefer to offer the full range of practical customization such that you -- the customer -- can feel satisfied that your final product reflects your vision to the greatest extent possible.

#### What is the artwork actually _for_ ?

While the technical particulars of rotogravure printing are beyond the scope of this explanation, it is important to note that it is initially printed on rolls and is "edge-to-edge": where the print for one bag ends, the next bag begins immediately. There are no bleeds or so-called "safe zones" - in a sense, this could be considered _WYSIWYG: What you see is what you get_. Even with this very direct connection between artwork and product, there are still structural factors that are easy to overlook, but may be important to the outcome of the project - examples might include:

- Zipper size and location
- Hanghole size and location
- Width of side seals

While 100% of the outside of the bag can be printed on, many people prefer to avoid positioning key elements over these locations. A template illustrating the structiral layout of the bag can be a great place to start or extend upon.

Additionally, seeing the position of elements -- particularly the zipper -- can provide a reality check when designing the bag: _"Will the vertical location of the zipper allow enough space for my product, or do I need to adjust the size?"_

This collection of templates/dielines is intended to make the gross sizing and layout operations speedy and of trivial complexity so that you can focus on the higher level design decisions.

Sometimes too much flexibility can lead to anxiety and uncertainty as to the soundness of the underlying foundation of the design - if you start out with one of these templates, you will at least have the assurance that the setup is fundamentally correct.
